# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh





Project Report: Food Recipe App
Overview
The Food Recipe App is a React-based web application that allows users to search for recipes, view detailed recipe information, and explore ingredients and cooking instructions. The app uses the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data based on user input, providing an interactive and user-friendly way to discover and prepare various dishes.

Features
Recipe Search:

Users can search for recipes by entering keywords (e.g., "burger") in the search bar.
The Search component handles user input, triggering API requests to the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data.
Recipe Details:

When a user selects a recipe, the FoodDetails component displays detailed information about the recipe, including ingredients, cooking instructions, preparation time, and serving size.
The data is fetched dynamically using the recipe ID and displayed once the API response is received.
Ingredient List:

The FoodIngredients component presents a list of ingredients needed for the selected recipe.
Each ingredient is displayed using the Item component, which shows an image, name, and quantity required.
Recipe Cards:

The FoodItem component displays individual recipe cards with images and titles.
Users can click on a "View Recipe" button, which triggers a detailed view of the selected recipe.
Styling:

The app is styled using modular CSS, ensuring a clean and organized codebase.
CSS modules such as fooddetails.module.css, item.module.css, and others are used to style components, providing a modern and responsive UI.
Technologies Used
React: The app is built with React, utilizing functional components, hooks (useState and useEffect), and modular CSS for styling.
Spoonacular API: The app integrates with the Spoonacular API to fetch recipe data, including ingredients and instructions, providing up-to-date and extensive recipe information.
JavaScript (ES6+): Modern JavaScript features, including async/await for API calls and arrow functions, are used throughout the project for a clean and efficient codebase.
Key Components
Search Component:

Fetches recipes from the Spoonacular API based on user input.
Manages search queries and updates the foodData state with the fetched recipes.
FoodDetails Component:

Displays detailed information about a selected recipe.
Uses useEffect to fetch data when the foodId changes, ensuring the displayed information is up-to-date.
FoodIngredients Component:

Displays the list of ingredients required for a recipe.
Uses the Item component for each ingredient, which includes an image, name, and amount.
FoodItem Component:

Represents a single recipe card with an image and title.
Includes a button to view more details, triggering the display of FoodDetails.
Container and InnerContainer Components:

These components wrap the application's content and ensure consistent styling and layout.
API Integration
The project uses the Spoonacular API to retrieve information about recipes, ingredients, and preparation instructions.
API calls are managed with fetch and utilize the useEffect hook to perform asynchronous operations.
Endpoint example: https://api.spoonacular.com/recipes/{foodId}/information.
Challenges & Solutions
Asynchronous Data Fetching:

Challenge: Ensuring the UI remains responsive while fetching data.
Solution: Implemented loading states (isLoading) to provide feedback to users during API requests.
State Management:

Challenge: Managing the state of selected recipes and search results.
Solution: Used React's useState for local state management, keeping the code simple and focused.
Responsive Design:

Challenge: Creating a user interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Solution: Leveraged CSS flexbox for layout and applied responsive styles to images and containers.
Conclusion
The Food Recipe App serves as a practical example of a React-based application that integrates with an external API to provide real-world functionality. It showcases the use of React hooks for state management and side effects, modular CSS for component-specific styling, and API integration for dynamic content delivery. This project demonstrates an understanding of building interactive, data-driven web applications using modern JavaScript frameworks.
